      <p> Coding is a wonderful hobby. Because of coding, you are able to use technology, with makes life so much easier. Coding is a wonderful hobby that can fill you with happiness. You use everyday technology at least once through coding. In fact, the reason why you are reading this is because of coding. Because I coded this and someone coded the platform you are using right now, you are able to read this text. Coding is all around us. From computers to phones. From google meets to search engines. From Ipads to Ipods. All around us there is at least one mechanical device. The reason why that mechanical device is there is because of coding. Coding is the best hobby suited for me because through coding, someone can change the world. </p>
